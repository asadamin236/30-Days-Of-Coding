-> Premitive Data Types:
Premitive are built-in data types that store single value. Following are the examples:

1. Numbers:
   Number are the numeric value either the float or number.
   let a = 6
   let b = 4.5
2. Strings:
   Strings are character like:
   let a = "Asad Amin";
3. Boolean:
   Boolean are the true and false like:
   let a = true;
   let b = false;
4. Null:
   Null are also the object by default because js count it as an object.
   let a = null;
   console.log(typeof a)
   object
5. Undefined:
   Undefined is when we define variable but not assign value by default like:
   let a;
   It's answer is undefined.
6. Symbol:
   Symbol always uniques identifiers
   e.g let x = Symbol("id")

-> Non Premitive Data Types:
Arrays: It stores multiles types of data and javascript represents it like object and it has multiples reference based data stores like numbers, string objects etc.
Objects:
It also store multiple data and represents the typeof objects data and stores multiples data like numbers,strings and boolean etc.
functions:
Functions in JavaScript are non-primitive because they are special objects (callable objects).
They can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.
